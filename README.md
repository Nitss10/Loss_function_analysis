# Loss_function_analysis
- Devise a loss function which will reduce the scores of the incorrect classes so the difference between the correct class score and incorrect class score is significant

- The project focuses on addressing the challenges associated with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image classification by exploring alternative loss functions beyond the commonly used Softmax loss function. The Softmax loss function, while widely utilized, has limitations in considering the probabilities of incorrect classes during loss calculation, leading to potential issues in model robustness. The study investigates alternative loss functions such as Center loss, CosFace loss, ArcFace loss, and Triplet loss, aiming to understand their impact on intra-class and inter-class decision boundaries for improved accuracy and robustness.

The project employs the CIFAR 10 dataset, consisting of 10 classes with 6000 32x32 images each, to compare the performance of different loss functions against the Softmax loss function. The evaluation includes the analysis of decision boundaries through confusion matrices, examining false negatives and false positives, and visualizing feature space vectors to observe differences in the distance between classes. The goal is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of alternative loss functions and their potential impact on enhancing the accuracy and flexibility of CNNs in image classification tasks.
